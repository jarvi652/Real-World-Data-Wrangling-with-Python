Project: Analyzing OpenPowerlifting Data
Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze powerlifting competition data from the OpenPowerlifting database. By combining data from two datasets, meets.csv and openpowerlifting.csv, we will explore patterns in athlete performance, competition dynamics, and the impact of various factors on lifting performance.

Specific Objectives:

Analyze performance trends: Identify trends in lifting performance over time and across different competitions.
Explore the impact of competition type: Compare performance metrics between different types of competitions (e.g., raw, equipped, single-ply).
Investigate athlete demographics: Analyze the relationship between athlete demographics (e.g., age, gender, weight class) and performance.
Identify key performance indicators: Determine the most important factors that contribute to successful lifting performance.
Visualize insights: Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
